Collections is a Framework.

What is Framework?
=====Predefined things already there means is called Framework.

Collections is used to handling a Data Structure.


What is Collections:

---Collections of objects to store a single objects that is called Collection.


Collection-----Collections

Collection is a interface

Collections is an class.

List,Set,Map--all them also interface

1. Characteristics of List:

   1. List is a Collection of homogeneous and hetergeneous data items.
   2. List is having index and index starts with zero.
   3. Based on index to add the data and delete the data is possible.
   4. List allowed duplicate items.
   5. Types of Child classes: ArrayList, LinkedList.

2. Characteristics of Set:
   
   
   1. set is a Collection of set of the elements
   2. Set is not having index and not index starts with zero.
   3. Based on index to add the data and delete the data is not possible.
   4. Set not allowed duplicate items.
   5. Types of Child classes: HashSet--Sequential Sorted, TreeSet---SortedSet

3.Characteristics of Map:
   
   1. its an Key value pair.

   2. Types: HashMap--Sequential Sorted Map,TreeMap---SortedMap.



Map<>a=new HashMap<>();


Generics----


Wrapper Classes:


primitivate data type to convert a objects is called auto boxing.

object converted into a primitive data type is called auto unboxing.


Wrapper Classes:


Integer, Float, Double, String, Boolean, Byte.


class Test<T> 
{
    
    T obj;
    Test(T obj) 
    { 
        this.obj = obj; 
    } 
    public T getObject()
    { 
        return this.obj; 
    }
}
 
// Driver class to test above
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // instance of Integer type
        Test<Integer> iObj = new Test<Integer>(15);
        System.out.println(iObj.getObject());
 
        // instance of String type
        Test<String> sObj= new Test<String>("GeeksForGeeks");
        System.out.println(sObj.getObject());
    }
}

Generics: Only the things is Type Safety.

java.lang.Objects methods

equals()

toString():

The toString() method returns the String representation of the object. 
If you print any object, Java compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the


hashCode()--
